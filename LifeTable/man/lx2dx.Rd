dx vector of single age \code{dx} from the lifetable. This is the density function, and it has various interpretations. Sums to radix.

\code{dx} will sum to the \code{lx} radix. Assumes but does not check for monontonicity in \code{lx}, so negative values can be produced, but are actually impossible.

<h2>axEstimate A function to estimate Chiang's a(x) values using a variety of methods.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a wrapper function to estimate the average
distance into an age interval lived by those dying within
that age interval. It calls 4 different methods:
<code>"keyfitz"</code>, <code>"schoen"</code>, <code>"midpoint"</code> or
<code>"preston"</code>. These generally use formulas proposed
by their respective namesakes, although all have been
modified by the current author in minor ways, usually in
order to provide values for the final ages, which are
left as NAs using certain methods. The Preston method is
called so not because he explicitly invented it, but
rather because it follows a series of rules of thumbs
drawn from other sources and described so well in Preston
et al (2001). See the individual ax estimation functions
to see the details of the various methods. a0 is handled
using a variant of the Andreev-Kingkade method.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  axEstimate(Mx, n, axsmooth = TRUE, method = "keyfitz",
    sex, verbose)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Mx</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of the age-specific central
death rates, calculated as D(x)/N(x) (deaths/exposure)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of age interval widths.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>axsmooth</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. default = <code>TRUE</code>. Should
the a(x) values be calculated from a smoothed M(x)
series? In this case, the M(x) series is smoothed within
the function for a(x) estimation, but the smoothed M(x)
function that was used is not returned. In general, it is
better to smooth the M(x) function prior to putting it in
this function, because the loess smoother used here has
no weights or offset. If this is not possible, loess M(x)
smoothing still produces more consistent and less erratic
a(x) estimates.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>either <code>"keyfitz"</code>, <code>"schoen"</code>,
<code>"preston"</code> or <code>"midpoint"</code>. Default =
<code>"keyfitz"</code>, although this is not recommended for
abridged ages. See comparisons in examples below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sex</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>"female"</code> or <code>"male"</code>. default
<code>"female"</code>. This is only used by the
<code>"preston"</code> method and need no be specified for any
other method.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is a wrapper, and it is called by the
lifetable function <code>LT()</code>, although it can be used
independently as well. For fuller explanations, see the
descriptions and code of the various methods. Formulas
are available in the referenced works.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>ax</code>, a numeric vector of a(x) values.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Be aware that all of the above methods are in some way a
hybrid: In the <code>"schoen"</code> and <code>"keyfitz"</code>
methods, I added procedures to produce values for the
final age(s) in a rudimentary way, and in the
<code>"preston"</code> method I also made a rudimentary
estimation procedure for a1 - a8 for single age data. For
all methods, a0 is calculated using a modified version of
the Andreev-Kingkade a0 rule. It is best not to use
<code>"keyfitz"</code> the default method, with abridged age
groups.

<p>This function dispatches to one of four different a(x)
estimation functions <code>axMidpoint</code> for the
&quot;midpoint&quot; method, <code>axSchoen</code> for the
<code>"schoen"</code> method, <code>axPreston</code> for the
&quot;preston&quot; method and <code>axKeyfitz</code> for the
<code>"keyfitz"</code> method. Look to these pages for
specifics. Compare using the examples below. This
function is called by <code>LT</code>, a single
decrement lifetable function.

<h2>axPreston approximation of a(x) using a few rules of thumb outlined by Preston et al (2001)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>a(x) estimated assuming death rate constant in each
interval. Most a values are estimated using <code>ax = n
  + (1/Mx) - n/(1-exp(-n*Mx))</code>, except for a0, which uses a
few rules of thumb derived from Coale and Demeny (1983)
and displayed in table 3.3 in Preston (2001). In the case
of single ages, I found that ages a1-a10 were all
estimated very close to .5, whereas the older ages a50+
were all estimated very close to what other methods
produce. In order to adjust a(x) values
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  axPreston(Mx, n, axsmooth = TRUE, sex = "female")
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Mx</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of the age-specific central
death rates, calculated as D(x)/N(x) (deaths/exposure).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of age interval widths.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>axsmooth</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. default = <code>TRUE</code>. Should
the a(x) values be calculated from a smoothed M(x)
series? In this case, the M(x) series is smoothed within
the function for a(x) estimation, but the smoothed M(x)
function that was used is not returned. In general, it is
better to smooth the M(x) function prior to putting it in
this function, because the loess smoother used here has
no weights or offset. If this is not possible, loess M(x)
smoothing still produces more consistent and less erratic
a(x) estimates.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sex</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>"male"</code> or <code>"female"</code>. default =
<code>"female"</code>. The Coale Demeny rules of thumb are
different for males and females.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the case of single ages, I found that ages a1-a10 were
all estimated very close to .5, whereas the older ages
a50+ were all estimated very close to what other methods
produce. In order to adjust a(x) values to reflect
dropping mortality at young ages, I wrote the following
rule of thumb, which scales based on the level of
mortality at age 0 and age 8. Basically the drop in
mortality from age 0 to 8 ought to produce successively
larger a(x) values, approaching .5. The increments in
a(x) at each age from 1 until 8 are thus applied
according to some fixed proportions, contained in the
variable 'jumps'. This is the last code chunk in the
function, which is displayed below under 'examples'. For
more info, look at the code.

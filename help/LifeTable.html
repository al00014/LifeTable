<h2>LifeTable, a package with a small set of useful lifetable functions.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The main function, <code>LT()</code>, is rather versatile,
accepting single-age or 5-year abridged data, and with a
variety of optional arguments. There is also a
sub-function, <code>axEstimate()</code>, which serves as a
wrapper for 4 different a(x) estimation methods. All
functions take as their basic argument the M(x) vector,
although the <code>LT()</code> function lets you start simply
with a vector of exposures (Nx) and a vector of death
counts (Dx) (better for smoothing). From that, all the
other lifetable functions are estimated using a series of
identities. Either an entire composed and rounded table
can be returned, or else the individual un-rounded
components. See further examples under individual
function pages. Example data is also provided, as
extracted from the Human Mortality Database in May, 2010.
These data are for Ukrainian males in 1965, and are given
in single ages and in 5-year abridged ages as well.

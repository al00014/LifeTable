<h2>A Nathan Keyfitz approximation of Chiang's a(x), average number of years lived by persons dying in the interval x,x+n.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An iterative approximation of Chiang's a(x), as proposed
by Nathan Keyfitz (1966) and described in Preston (2001).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  axKeyfitz(Mx, n, axsmooth = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Mx</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector of the age-specific central
death rates, calculated as D(x)/N(x) (deaths/exposure)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of age interval widths.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>axsmooth</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. default = <code>TRUE</code>. Should
the a(x) values be calculated from a smoothed M(x)
series? In this case, the M(x) series is smoothed within
the function for a(x) estimation, but the smoothed M(x)
function that was used is not returned. In general, it is
better to smooth the M(x) function prior to putting it in
this function, because the loess smoother used here has
no weights or offset. If this is not possible, loess M(x)
smoothing still produces more consistent and less erratic
a(x) estimates.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This procedure usually converges very quickly. First, dx
is estimated from an ax vector of interval midpoints
(except age 0, which is ignored in this process. This
d(x) is used to estimate another a(x) based on d(x)
slopes. Repeat 7 times. The Keyfitz iterative procedure
provides no estimates for the final two ages. These I
impute (see last part of code, below) based on the a(x)
slope for the last estimated interval. In the penultimate
interval, this increment is multiplied by 1.5, and again
multiplied by 1.5 for the final a(x) value, which has the
effect of exaggerating the tendency at the end of the
series.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns <code>ax</code>, a numeric vector of a(x) values.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Preston warns that this method should only be used when
the age intervals are equal, which is not the case with
abridged data. The function will still estimate using
such data, but be wary.

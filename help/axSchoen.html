<h2>axSchoen Schoen's MDAT approximation of Chiang's a(x), average number of years lived by persons dying in the interval x, x + n.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This estimation technique of Chiang's a(x) was proposed
by Schoen (1978) and is called the Mean Duration at
Transfer (MDAT) method. Adjacent values of the force of
mortality function, M(x), assumed to be the lifetable
m(x), are used to estimate the mean age at exit from each
interval.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  axSchoen(Mx, n, axsmooth = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Mx</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of the age-specific central
death rates, calculated as D(x)/N(x) (deaths/exposure)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of age interval widths.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>axsmooth</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. default = <code>TRUE</code>. Should
the a(x) values be calculated from a smoothed M(x)
series? In this case, the M(x) series is smoothed within
the function for a(x) estimation, but the smoothed M(x)
function that was used is not returned. In general, it is
better to smooth the M(x) function prior to putting it in
this function, because the loess smoother used here has
no weights or offset. If this is not possible, loess M(x)
smoothing still produces more consistent and less erratic
a(x) estimates.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The very last a(x) value is imputed using linear
extrapolation of the prior 3 points. For most demographic
measures, precision at the upper ages has little or no
effect on results. In general, this estimation procedure
works very well, and produces results very similar to the
Keyfitz iterative procedure, but the estimates at the
final ages tend to turn upward, where they ought to slope
downward instead.

# note that at old ages the a(x) estimate shoots upward. It should in fact decline.
# I am still not sure whether this is due to the formula or my implementation of it...
